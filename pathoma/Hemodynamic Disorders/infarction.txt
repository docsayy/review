Infarction is tissue necrosis due to loss of blood supply.

Most infarcts are caused by thrombosis or embolism.

Solid organs develop pale infarcts.

Lung and intestine develop red infarcts.

Brain infarcts undergo liquefactive necrosis.

Testicular infarcts are hemorrhagic.

Reperfusion can cause additional tissue injury.
