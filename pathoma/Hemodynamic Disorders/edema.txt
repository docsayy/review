Edema is accumulation of excess fluid in the interstitial space.

Starling forces regulate fluid movement across capillaries.

Increased hydrostatic pressure causes edema.

Decreased plasma oncotic pressure causes edema.

Increased vascular permeability causes edema.

Lymphatic obstruction causes edema.

Congestive heart failure increases hydrostatic pressure and causes edema.

Cirrhosis decreases albumin and causes edema.

Nephrotic syndrome decreases albumin and causes edema.

Inflammation increases vascular permeability and causes edema.
