Shock is systemic hypoperfusion causing organ dysfunction.

Hypovolemic shock is caused by blood or fluid loss.

Cardiogenic shock is caused by pump failure.

Septic shock is caused by systemic infection and vasodilation.

Neurogenic shock is caused by loss of vascular tone.

Anaphylactic shock is caused by IgE-mediated vasodilation.

Shock causes cellular hypoxia and organ failure.

Prolonged shock leads to multi-organ dysfunction.
