A mutation is a permanent change in DNA sequence.

Point mutations affect a single nucleotide.

Missense mutations change one amino acid.

Nonsense mutations create a premature stop codon.

Frameshift mutations result from insertions or deletions.

Frameshift mutations alter the reading frame of DNA.

Silent mutations do not change amino acid sequence.

Loss-of-function mutations reduce protein activity.

Gain-of-function mutations increase or create new protein activity.

Somatic mutations occur in non-germline cells.

Germline mutations are inherited.
