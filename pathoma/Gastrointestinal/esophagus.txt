The esophagus is lined by non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium.

GERD is reflux of gastric acid into the esophagus.

GERD causes basal cell hyperplasia and elongation of lamina propria papillae.

Chronic GERD can cause Barrett esophagus.

Barrett esophagus is metaplasia from squamous epithelium to non-ciliated columnar epithelium.

Barrett esophagus increases risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma.

Achalasia is failure of lower esophageal sphincter relaxation.

Achalasia causes progressive dysphagia to solids and liquids.

Achalasia is caused by loss of ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus.

Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is associated with smoking and alcohol.

Esophageal adenocarcinoma commonly arises from Barrett esophagus.
