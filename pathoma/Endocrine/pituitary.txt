The pituitary gland has anterior and posterior lobes.

The anterior pituitary produces ACTH, TSH, GH, prolactin, FSH, and LH.

Pituitary adenomas are the most common pituitary tumors.

Prolactinomas cause galactorrhea and amenorrhea.

Growth hormone–secreting adenomas cause acromegaly in adults.

ACTH-secreting adenomas cause Cushing disease.

Pituitary macroadenomas may cause visual field defects.

Sheehan syndrome is postpartum pituitary infarction.
