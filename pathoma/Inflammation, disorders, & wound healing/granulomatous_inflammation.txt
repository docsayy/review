Granulomatous inflammation is a form of chronic inflammation.

Granulomas contain epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells.

Granulomas are surrounded by a rim of lymphocytes.

Non-caseating granulomas lack central necrosis.

Sarcoidosis causes non-caseating granulomas.

Crohn disease causes non-caseating granulomas.

Caseating granulomas have central necrosis.

Tuberculosis causes caseating granulomas.

Fungal infections cause caseating granulomas.

Macrophages present antigen to CD4 cells to initiate granuloma formation.

IL-12 from macrophages induces TH1 differentiation.

TH1 cells secrete IFN-γ to activate macrophages into epithelioid cells.
