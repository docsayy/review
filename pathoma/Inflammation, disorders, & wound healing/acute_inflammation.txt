Inflammation is the process by which immune cells and plasma proteins exit blood vessels into tissue.

Acute inflammation is defined by the presence of neutrophils in tissue.

Acute inflammation arises in response to infection or necrosis.

Necrosis is always followed by acute inflammation.

The goal of acute inflammation is to clear pathogens or necrotic debris.

Acute inflammation is part of innate immunity.

Toll-like receptors recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns.

Toll-like receptors also recognize damage-associated molecular patterns.

TLR-4 on macrophages recognizes lipopolysaccharide from gram-negative bacteria.

NF-κB is the master regulator that activates acute inflammation.

Macrophages release IL-1 and TNF to induce fever.

Cyclooxygenase increases prostaglandin E2 in the hypothalamus to raise body temperature.

Histamine causes vasodilation and increased vascular permeability.

Leukotrienes cause bronchoconstriction and increased vascular permeability.

LTB4 attracts and activates neutrophils.

C5a attracts neutrophils.

IL-8 attracts neutrophils.

Bacterial products attract neutrophils.

Bradykinin causes pain and vasodilation.

PGE2 causes pain and fever.

Rubor and calor result from vasodilation.

Tumor (swelling) results from increased vascular permeability.

Dolor (pain) results from bradykinin and PGE2.
