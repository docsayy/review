Phagocytosis occurs inside phagolysosomes.

Oxygen-dependent killing uses NADPH oxidase to generate superoxide.

Superoxide is converted to hydrogen peroxide by superoxide dismutase.

Hydrogen peroxide is converted to hypochlorite by myeloperoxidase.

Hypochlorite is the main bactericidal agent.

Chronic granulomatous disease is caused by NADPH oxidase deficiency.

Chronic granulomatous disease leads to recurrent catalase-positive infections.

Catalase-positive organisms destroy hydrogen peroxide.

Nitroblue tetrazolium test screens for NADPH oxidase function.

Oxygen-independent killing uses lysosomal enzymes.

Neutrophils die by apoptosis after completing acute inflammation.

Pus is composed of dead neutrophils.

Macrophages appear after 2 to 3 days of acute inflammation.

Macrophages secrete IL-10 and TGF-β to suppress inflammation.

Macrophages secrete IL-8 to recruit more neutrophils when needed.
