Neutrophils exit blood vessels at post-capillary venules.

Margination is movement of neutrophils to vessel periphery during vasodilation.

Rolling occurs via selectins on endothelium binding sialyl-Lewis X on neutrophils.

P-selectin is released from Weibel-Palade bodies by histamine.

E-selectin is induced by IL-1 and TNF.

Adhesion occurs when integrins on neutrophils bind CAMs on endothelium.

IL-1 and TNF upregulate CAMs on endothelium.

C5a and LTB4 upregulate integrins on neutrophils.

Transmigration occurs across post-capillary venules.

Chemotaxis directs neutrophils toward IL-8, C5a, LTB4, and bacterial products.

Opsonins enhance phagocytosis.

IgG and C3b are major opsonins.

Leukocyte adhesion deficiency is caused by mutation in CD18 integrin.

Delayed umbilical cord separation occurs in leukocyte adhesion deficiency.

Lack of pus formation occurs in leukocyte adhesion deficiency.
