Chronic inflammation is defined by lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration.

Chronic inflammation occurs with persistent infection, autoimmunity, or foreign material.

T cells mature in the thymus into CD4 or CD8 cells.

CD4 T cells recognize antigen on MHC II.

CD8 T cells recognize antigen on MHC I.

B7 on antigen-presenting cells binds CD28 on CD4 cells for second signal.

CD40 on B cells binds CD40L on CD4 cells for activation.

Activated CD4 TH1 cells secrete IFN-γ.

IFN-γ enhances macrophage killing ability.

Activated CD4 TH2 cells secrete IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10.

IL-4 induces class switching to IgE and IgG.

IL-5 activates eosinophils and induces IgA class switching.

IL-10 suppresses TH1 response.

CD8 T cells kill via perforin and granzyme.

CD8 T cells also kill via Fas-FasL apoptosis.

B cells present antigen to CD4 cells via MHC II.

B cells undergo isotype switching and affinity maturation under TH2 cytokines.
