Thrombotic microangiopathy is small vessel platelet-rich thrombosis.

Schistocytes are fragmented red blood cells seen in microangiopathy.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by ADAMTS13 deficiency.

ADAMTS13 normally cleaves von Willebrand factor multimers.

Hemolytic uremic syndrome is commonly triggered by shiga toxin.

Shiga toxin damages endothelial cells.

Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome is caused by complement dysregulation.
