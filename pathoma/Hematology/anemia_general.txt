Anemia is a decrease in red blood cell mass.

Anemia is classified by mean corpuscular volume.

Microcytic anemia has low mean corpuscular volume.

Normocytic anemia has normal mean corpuscular volume.

Macrocytic anemia has high mean corpuscular volume.

Reticulocyte count reflects bone marrow response.

Low reticulocyte count indicates decreased red cell production.

High reticulocyte count indicates increased red cell destruction or loss.
