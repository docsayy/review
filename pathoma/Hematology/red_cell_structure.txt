Red blood cells are biconcave discs that lack nuclei.

Red blood cells contain hemoglobin for oxygen transport.

Hemoglobin is composed of heme and globin chains.

Heme contains iron in the ferrous state.

Globin chains are produced in ribosomes of erythroid precursors.

Erythropoietin stimulates red blood cell production.

Erythropoietin is produced by the kidney in response to hypoxia.
