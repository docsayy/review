Restrictive lung disease is characterized by decreased lung compliance.

Restrictive lung disease reduces total lung capacity.

Pulmonary fibrosis is a common restrictive lung disease.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis causes progressive dyspnea.

Fibrosis thickens alveolar septa and impairs gas exchange.

Sarcoidosis causes non-caseating granulomas in lungs.

Pneumoconiosis results from inhalation of inorganic dust.

Silicosis increases risk of tuberculosis.

Asbestosis causes interstitial fibrosis and pleural plaques.

Asbestos exposure increases risk of mesothelioma.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is immune-mediated interstitial lung disease.
