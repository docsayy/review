The respiratory tract is divided into a conducting zone and a respiratory zone.

The conducting zone includes nasal cavity, trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles.

The respiratory zone includes respiratory bronchioles and alveoli.

Goblet cells in the airways produce mucus.

Cilia propel mucus toward the pharynx.

Smoking damages cilia and impairs mucus clearance.

Chronic irritation increases goblet cell number.

Increased goblet cells contribute to airway obstruction.
