Pulmonary embolism usually arises from deep vein thrombosis.

Pulmonary embolism causes ventilation-perfusion mismatch.

Large pulmonary emboli cause acute right heart strain.

Chronic pulmonary emboli can cause pulmonary hypertension.

Pulmonary hypertension causes right ventricular hypertrophy.

Chronic hypoxia causes vasoconstriction of pulmonary arteries.

Pulmonary hypertension may lead to cor pulmonale.

Cor pulmonale is right heart failure secondary to lung disease.
