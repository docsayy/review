Asthma is reversible airway obstruction.

Asthma is caused by bronchoconstriction, inflammation, and mucus plugging.

Eosinophils play a major role in asthma.

COPD is irreversible airflow limitation.

Chronic bronchitis is defined by productive cough for at least three months in two consecutive years.

Chronic bronchitis is associated with mucus gland hypertrophy.

Emphysema is destruction of alveolar walls leading to airspace enlargement.

Centriacinar emphysema is strongly associated with smoking.

Panacinar emphysema is associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency causes early-onset emphysema.

Blue bloater refers to chronic bronchitis phenotype.

Pink puffer refers to emphysema phenotype.
