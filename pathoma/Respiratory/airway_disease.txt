The respiratory tract is divided into conducting airways and gas-exchange regions.

The conducting zone includes trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles.

The respiratory zone includes alveoli.

Goblet cells produce mucus in the airways.

Cilia move mucus toward the pharynx.

Smoking impairs ciliary function.

Chronic airway irritation increases goblet cells.
