Germ cell tumors are the most common testicular cancers.

Seminoma is the most common type of germ cell tumor.

Seminoma cells are large with clear cytoplasm and central nuclei.

Seminomas are sensitive to radiation.

Nonseminomatous germ cell tumors include embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, choriocarcinoma, and teratoma.

Yolk sac tumors produce alpha-fetoprotein.

Choriocarcinoma produces human chorionic gonadotropin.

Mixed germ cell tumors contain more than one histologic type.

Testicular cancer commonly presents as a painless testicular mass.
