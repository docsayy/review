Myocardial infarction occurs when ischemia lasts long enough to cause irreversible myocyte injury.

Irreversible injury to cardiac myocytes begins after approximately 20 minutes of ischemia.

Myocardial infarction causes coagulative necrosis of cardiac muscle.

Necrotic myocardium loses nuclei and cross striations.

Neutrophils infiltrate infarcted myocardium within the first few days.

Macrophages remove necrotic tissue after neutrophils.

Granulation tissue forms in the infarct zone during healing.

Fibrous scar replaces necrotic myocardium.

Subendocardium is the most vulnerable region to ischemia.

Transmural infarction occurs when full thickness of myocardium is necrotic.

Subendocardial infarction involves only inner myocardial layers.

ST elevation myocardial infarction corresponds to transmural infarction.

Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction corresponds to subendocardial infarction.

Troponin is the most sensitive and specific marker of myocardial injury.

CK-MB is useful to detect reinfarction.

Myocardial rupture is a fatal complication of infarction.

Free wall rupture leads to cardiac tamponade.

Papillary muscle rupture leads to acute severe mitral regurgitation.

Ventricular septal rupture leads to a new harsh holosystolic murmur.

Dressler syndrome is autoimmune pericarditis occurring weeks after infarction.

Ventricular aneurysm is a late complication of infarction.
