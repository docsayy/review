Aortic stenosis is most commonly caused by age-related calcific degeneration.

Calcific aortic stenosis produces progressive narrowing of the valve orifice.

Bicuspid aortic valve predisposes to early aortic stenosis.

Aortic stenosis causes concentric left ventricular hypertrophy.

Classic symptoms of aortic stenosis are syncope, angina, and dyspnea.

Mitral stenosis is most commonly caused by rheumatic heart disease.

Mitral stenosis causes left atrial enlargement.

Left atrial enlargement predisposes to atrial fibrillation.

Atrial fibrillation increases risk of thromboembolism.

Mitral regurgitation causes volume overload of left atrium and left ventricle.

Mitral valve prolapse is caused by myxomatous degeneration of valve leaflets.

Mitral valve prolapse produces a mid-systolic click.

Tricuspid regurgitation is commonly due to right ventricular dilation.
