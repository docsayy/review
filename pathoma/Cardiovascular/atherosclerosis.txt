Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of arterial walls.

Endothelial injury initiates atherosclerosis.

LDL enters the intima and becomes oxidized.

Macrophages ingest oxidized LDL and become foam cells.

Foam cells form fatty streaks.

Smooth muscle migration and collagen deposition form fibrous plaques.

Plaque rupture triggers thrombosis.

Atherosclerosis commonly affects coronary arteries.

Atherosclerosis commonly affects carotid arteries.

Atherosclerosis commonly affects lower extremity arteries.
