Neurons are highly sensitive to hypoxia.

Cerebral ischemia causes liquefactive necrosis.

Liquefactive necrosis results in cystic spaces in brain tissue.

Reactive gliosis occurs after CNS injury.

Astrocytes proliferate during gliosis.

Increased intracranial pressure can cause brain herniation.

Uncal herniation compresses cranial nerve III and causes pupil dilation.
