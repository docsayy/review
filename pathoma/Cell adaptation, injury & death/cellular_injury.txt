Cellular injury occurs when stress exceeds the cell’s ability to adapt.

Cell injury depends on the type of stress, severity, and cell type.

Neurons tolerate hypoxia for only 3 to 5 minutes.

Skeletal muscle tolerates hypoxia for long periods.

Hypoxia causes cellular injury by reduced oxygen delivery.

Anemia causes normal PaO2 with reduced oxygen content.

Carbon monoxide poisoning causes normal PaO2 with reduced oxygen saturation.

Methemoglobinemia causes normal PaO2 with reduced oxygen saturation.

Shock is decreased perfusion of vital organs.

Budd-Chiari syndrome is hepatic vein obstruction causing liver infarction.

Low ATP causes lactic acidosis and failure of membrane ion pumps.

Reversible injury shows cellular swelling and membrane blebbing.

Irreversible injury shows membrane damage and enzyme leakage.

Cytochrome c release activates apoptosis.
