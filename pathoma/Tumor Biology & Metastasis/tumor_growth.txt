Tumors require progressive genetic mutations to grow.

Cancers accumulate mutations over many cell divisions.

Tumors that present late have accumulated many mutations.

Loss of tumor suppressor genes promotes tumor progression.

Mutation of apoptosis regulators allows cell survival.

Cancer cells become independent of normal growth signals.

Cancer cells lose contact inhibition.

Cancer cells acquire limitless replicative potential.

Telomerase activation allows continuous cell division.
