Metastasis is spread of tumor cells to distant sites.

Metastasis is the most reliable indicator of malignancy.

Tumor cells lose adhesion molecules to detach from primary mass.

E-cadherin loss promotes tumor cell detachment.

Tumor cells degrade extracellular matrix using proteases.

Tumor cells enter blood vessels by intravasation.

Circulating tumor cells evade immune destruction.

Tumor cells exit vessels by extravasation.

Metastatic tumors grow at distant organs.

Carcinomas spread primarily via lymphatics.

Sarcomas spread primarily via bloodstream.
