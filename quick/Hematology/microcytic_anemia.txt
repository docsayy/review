32F + low MCV + low Hb + smear is shown below; Dx? Answer = iron deficiency anemia (IDA); smear shows pale RBCs (i.e., with central pallor).

32F + low MCV + low Hb + smear is show below; Dx? Answer = thalassemia; smear shows target cells; these may be seen in other DDx, however on USMLE thalassemia is by far the highest yield association.

32F + low MCV + low Hb; next best step in Mx? -> answer = “check serum iron and ferritin.”.

32F + low MCV + low Hb + low Fe + low ferritin; Dx? -> answer = IDA.

32F + low MCV + low Hb + normal Fe + normal ferritin; Dx? -> answer = thalassemia. Presents as a microcytic anemia despite a normal iron and ferritin.

32F + normal MCV + low Hb + low Fe + normal ferritin; Dx? -> answer = anemia of chronic disease (AoCD). In contrast, IDA you'll have low iron + low ferritin; thalassemia you'll have normal iron + normal ferritin. Also, for AoCD, there will be obvious cause like renal failure, autoimmune disease, cancer, or chronic infection like hepatitis B/C.

32F + rheumatoid arthritis + low MCV + low Hb + low Fe + normal ferritin; Dx? -> answer = AoCD; student says, “Wait, but I thought MCV was supposed to be normal in AoCD.” -> plenty of 2CK-level Qs give low MCV for AoCD. That’s you’re value point.

32F + low MCV + low Hb + high red cell distribution width (RDW); Dx? -> answer = IDA almost always. One question in history gives high RDW for thalassemia (on FM form 4). But usually this is seen in IDA.

32F + low MCV + low Hb + low/normal RDW; Dx? -> answer = thalassemia.

32F + low MCV + low Hb + high transferrin binding capacity; Dx? -> answer = IDA.

32F + low MCV + low Hb + low/normal transferrin binding capacity; Dx? -> AoCD.

32F + low MCV + low Hb + no improvement with iron supplementation; Dx + next best step in Mx? -> answer = thalassemia; next best step = hemoglobin electrophoresis.

Mechanism for thalassemia? -> decreased production of one type of hemoglobin chain (i.e., if ↓ alpha chain production, then Dx is alpha thalassemia; same for beta, respectively).

32F + pregnant + completely asymptomatic till this point + low MCV + low Hb + starts taking prenatal vitamin supplement + three weeks later still has low MCV and low Hb; next best step? -> answer = hemoglobin electrophoresis. Dx = thalassemia.

32F + pregnant + Hx of chronic fatigue + low MCV + low Hb + normal iron and ferritin; Dx? -> answer = alpha thalassemia trait (two mutations) or beta-thalassemia minor; patient will be adult who presents similar to mild/moderate IDA but have normal serum iron and ferritin.

8F + severe anemia + hepatosplenomegaly + normal iron and ferritin + Hb electrophoresis shows tetrameric beta-hemoglobin (β4); Dx? -> answer = hemoglobin H disease (three alpha mutations).

32F + pregnant + fetus dies in utero + fetal blood sampling shows tetrameric gamma-hemoglobin (χ4); Dx? -> hemoglobin Barts (four alpha mutations); fatal in utero.

6M + low MCV + low Hb + hepatosplenomegaly + HbA2 6% + following x-ray of head; Dx? Answer = beta-thalassemia major; almost always a child; “chipmunk facies/skull” and hepatosplenomegaly occur due to ↑↑ extramedullary hematopoiesis.

6M + low MCV + low Hb + normal iron and ferritin + hepatosplenomegaly + HbA2 6%; Tx? -> answer = serial blood transfusions + iron chelation therapy (e.g., deferoxamine) for beta-thalassemia major; serial blood transfusions done to Tx thalassemia result in iron overload; do not confuse this type of iron overload with that of hereditary hemochromatosis, which is instead managed with serial phlebotomy, not chelation therapy. The iron overload due to serial transfusions is called secondary hemochromatosis (transfusional siderosis).

10F + receiving transfusions for beta-thalassemia major; Q asks: to avoid iron overload, measurement of which of the following is most sensitive in assessing patient’s iron stores; answer = ferritin; wrong answer are iron saturation and transferrin.

22F + low MCV + low Hb + fatigue + HbA2 6%; Dx? -> beta-thalassemia minor; usually adult.

“What’s the deal with the HbA2. What does that mean?” -> highest yield point for beta-thalassemia major and minor is that HbA2 (α2δ2; alpha2-delta2) is increased on hemoglobin electrophoresis. Normal adult Hb is HbA1 (α2β2); fetal Hb is HbF (α2χ2; alpha2-gamma2).

72M + fatigue + smear shows pale RBCs + Hb 9.4 g/dL; most likely cause? -> answer = GI blood loss (IDA) -> must think diverticular bleed, colorectal cancer, and angiodysplasia causing IDA in elderly patient with fatigue; 2CK-level Qs will jump straight to colonoscopy as the answer.

Mechanism of AoCD? -> inflammatory state leads to ↑ IL-6 production by liver -> ↑ hepcidin production by liver -> ↓ ferroportin acivity -> ↓ iron release by gut enterocytes and general cellular stores -> ↓ iron transport in blood -> ferritin levels are normal but serum iron is ↓. Transferrin is also ↓, resulting in ↓ total iron binding capacity (TIBC). This means even though iron is low in the blood, since transferrin is also low, there’s still ↓ binding capacity for iron overall. In contrast, in IDA, TIBC is high (i.e., transferrin goes ↑ to compensate for low serum iron; in AoCD, transferrin secretion is suppressed despite ↓ serum iron).

Student says, “But wait, isn’t this similar to thalassemia, where serum iron is decreased but ferritin is normal?” -> Good question, but in thalassemia, 1) they won’t give you a vignette with autoimmune disease, organ failure, or chronic illness, and 2) they’ll often throw in target cells, ↓ RDW, or Hb electrophoresis findings.

6F + Hx of multiple episodes of sore joints + fever of 102F + salmon-pink rash over body + high ESR + Hb of 9 g/dL + MCV 72; Dx? -> anemia of chronic disease secondary to juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA; aka juvenile idiopathic arthritis; JIA) -> if Q gives you low MCV in AoCD, the vignette will be overwhelmingly obvious for an autoimmune disease + you can eliminate the other answers.

68M + hasn’t been to doctor in years + Hb 8.6 + Hct 25% + MCV 90 + normal RDW + normal iron + normal ferritin + normal transferrin saturation + creatinine 2.9; Dx + Tx? -> AoCD caused by chronic renal insufficiency. Tx = EPO.

Does anything shift the curve to the left? -> notably fetal hemoglobin (HbF) has left-shifted curve. - Why is HbF (α2χ2) left-shifted compared to adult hemoglobin (HbA1; α2β2)? -> The beta chain on adult hemoglobin has a charged histidine that forms an ionic bond with 2,3-BPG; this histidine is replaced with an uncharged serine on the gamma chain of HbF that does not bind 2,3-BPG. - “Why can deoxygenated blood carry more CO2 for a given pCO2 than oxygenated blood?” -> answer = “deoxyhemoglobin is a better buffer of hydrogen ions than oxyhemoglobin.” Student immediately says wtf? -> At peripheral tissues, CO2 production is ↑; this diffuses into the RBC, combines with water to make H2CO3, which then equilibrates to bicarb and a proton. The proton hops onto the.

Classic hematologic parameters in sideroblastic anemia? -> ↑ serum iron + ↑ ferritin + ↑ transferrin saturation + ↓ Hb; MCV can be normal/↓ in XR form or ↑ MCV in acquired forms. o Bottom line: remember ↑ iron across the board + MCV can be variable.

43M + daily alcohol use + ↑ serum iron + ↑ ferritin + ↑ transferrin saturation + ↓ Hb; Dx? -> answer = alcohol-induced sideroblastic anemia.

44M + hunter + recent cognitive decline + microcytic anemia + wrist drop + ↑ δ-ALA + ↑ RBC protoporphyrin; Dx? -> answer = lead poisoning -> inhibits ferrochelatase (causes ↑ RBC protoporphyrin) and δ-ALA dehydratase (↑ δ-ALA); lead poisoning classically causes microcytic anemia (HY finding, especially in adults; vignette is not always going to say kid eating paint chips in family’s new house); and neuropathy (e.g., wrist drop, foot drop).

18-month-old girl + scleral icterus + pallor + hepatosplenomegaly + Hb 5.6 g/dL + bilirubin 3 mg/dL (normal ~1.0) + smear shows severe hypochromia + nucleated erythrocytes + microcytosis + DNA analysis shows mutation in beta-globin gene; what’s the Dx + what arrows do you expect for HbF, HbA2/HbA1 ratio, reticulocyte count; answer = ↑ HbF, ↑ HbA2/HbA1 ratio, ↑ reticulocyte count; Dx is beta-thalassemia accompanied by severe anemia + RBC turnover.
