Mechanism of PCV? -> JAK2 mutation causing “proliferation of bone marrow stem cells.” Erythropoietin (EPO) is decreased because it is suppressed. Although oxygen sats should be as close to 100% as possible, patients generally hold up fine with sats >94%.

50F smoker + Hx of COPD + Hb 18.5 g/dL; Dx + mechanism? -> answer = secondary polycythemia -> increased EPO due to low oxygen tension (e.g., in COPD, CF, etc.) -> mechanism is “proliferation of erythroid precursors” -> this is because the high EPO results in an elevation of only RBCs; in PCV, O2 sats would be 94% or greater and WBCs and/or platelets may be elevated.

Answer = renal cell carcinoma (RCC) -> can cause paraneoplastic secondary polycythemia due to EPO secretion as well as hypercalcemia due to PTHrp secretion (latter also squamous.

32F + Hx of Crohn + low Hb + MCV 90; Dx? -> answer = AoCD -> seen in autoimmune disease (i.e., RA, IBD, SLE), organ failure (i.e., renal, liver), chronic infection (e.g., hepatitis B/C).

“What about MCV and AoCD?” -> classically normal MCV in anemia of chronic disease (normocytic anemia), but some 2CK NBME Qs have ↓ MCV -> student says, “Wait how is this AoCD? Isn’t MCV supposed to be normal in AoCD?” -> my response: “Yes, you’re right, but various 2CK have it ↓.” -> So your take-home regarding AoCD should be: classically normal, but can absolutely be ↓ on USMLE.

44F + chronic alcoholism + abdominal fluid wave + low Hb + MCV 84; Dx? -> AoCD.

Tx of AoCD? -> answer = supportive care / treat the underlying condition; EPO is the answer only if renal failure is the etiology; if renal failure is not the underlying Dx, EPO is the wrong answer. this for Qs asking you how to Dx spherocytosis. USMLE also wants you to know the spherocytes in hereditary spherocytosis are normochromic, normocytic.
