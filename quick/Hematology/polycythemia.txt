Normal Hb? -> according to literature, in men + elderly it’s 13.0-17.5 g/dL; menstruating females 12.0-17.5 g/dL. Below these thresholds, patient has anemia. Above, patient has polycythemia. - Normal Hct? -> Men and elderly: 42-52%; women: 36-46%.

65M + pain in fingertips for 3 weeks + facial plethora + splenomegaly + Hb 20.2 g/dL + WBCs 14,500 with normal differential + normal platelets + O2 sats 94% on room air; Dx + Tx? -> answer = polycythemia vera (PCV); Tx = phlebotomy.

48F + pruritis after a shower + high WBCs + Hb 19.5 g/dL; Dx? -> answer = PCV; pruritis after a shower is a classic finding -> reflect basophilia; WBC count can be normal or elevated in PCV.

55M smoker + red urine + polycythemia + hypercalcemia + unknown biopsy specimen is shown; Dx? hyperviscosity Sx are also seen in polycythemia.

MOA of chloroquine/mefloquine? -> inhibit Plasmodium heme polymerase. - 20F + went to Africa + took chloroquine prophylaxis + got malaria anyway; why? -> answer = chloroquine resistance; wrong answer is medical noncompliance. Chloroquine resistance is HY. - 20F + has malaria + treated appropriately + several weeks later has a resurgence of the malaria; why? -> answer = “presence of extra-erythrocytic form of organism” -> P. vivax and ovale cause hypnozoites, which are a latent intrahepatic form of the disease.
