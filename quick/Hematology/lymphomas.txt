53M + coronary artery disease + asks physician about celecoxib + physician is reluctant to prescribe because of increased risk of MI with celecoxib; Q asks why there is ↑ risk; answer = “inhibition of prostacyclin (PGI2) formation without inhibition of thromboxane A2 in platelet”; celecoxib is a COX2 selective inhibitor.

Answer = Burkitt; image is classic “starry sky” appearance; blue cells are lymphocytes; clear cells are macrophages.

NBME Q for Step 1 points to a macrophage on the starry sky histo and asks what cellular process is occurring; answer = apoptosis -> macrophages are called tingible (not tangible) body macrophages -> contain lots of phagocytosed cells at various stages of apoptosis.

55M + fever + night sweats + weight loss + fluid wave in abdomen + abdominal paracentesis yields 300mL of milky fluid; Dx? -> chylothorax secondary to intra-abdominal Burkitt lymphoma.

Gene involved in Burkitt + what is it? -> c-myc -> transcription factor.

Gene involved in follicular lymphoma + what is it? -> answer = bcl-2 -> anti-apoptotic molecule.

72M + acute-onset highly aggressive B cell lymphoma; Dx? -> diffuse-large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL); most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in adults; highly aggressive.

“What does non-Hodgkin vs Hodgkin mean?” -> Hodgkin is a type of lymphoma that has pathognomonic Reed-Sternberg cells on lymph node biopsy (owl-eye appearance); RS cells are CD15 and CD30 positive; some resources say NHL has B-symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss) whereas in Hodgkin they are more rare, but on the USMLE, B-symptoms can occur in either; EBV can also cause either; Hodgkin may present with contiguous spread, where affected areas are in close proximity, whereas NHL can spread more haphazardly. NHL just refers to any lymphoma that doesn’t have Reed-Sternberg cells.

Reed-Sternberg cells.

“Do I need to know the different types of Hodgkin lymphoma?” -> highest yield points: o Nodular sclerosing variant is more common in women.

More Reed-Sternberg cells = poorer prognosis.

▪ Leukocyte-rich Hodgkin = high lymphocytes + low RS cells (better prognosis). ▪ Leukocyte-deplete Hodgkin = low lymphocytes + high RS cells (poor prognosis).

44M + Hx of Hodgkin disease + nephrotic syndrome; what’s the renal Dx? -> answer = minimal change disease (MCD); student says, “Wtf? But I thought that’s pediatrics.” -> 9 times out of 10, yes, it follows viral infection in a kid, but it is also associated with Hodgkin lymphoma in adults.

16F + painless lateral neck mass + a mediastinal mass; Dx? -> answer = Hodgkin disease.

16F + painless lateral neck mass + hepatomegaly; Dx? -> answer= Hodgkin disease -> classic vignette presents as painless lateral neck mass (doesn’t wax and wane like follicular NHL) + either a mediastinal mass or hepatomegaly; the mediastinal mass is not a thymoma; it’s mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
