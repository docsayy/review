82F + back pain + M-protein spike showing IgG kappa + epistaxis; why the epistaxis? -> uremic platelet dysfunction secondary to renal failure from multiple myeloma (renal amyloidosis). - “Can you tell me the highest yield points about multiple myeloma?”.

Plasma cells secrete non-functional immunoglobulin light-chains; these are mostly IgG; serum protein electrophoresis is the next best step in the Dx of multiple myeloma, which will show the ↑↑ IgG kappa and lamda; this ↑↑ in IgG is called an M-protein spike; this has nothing to do with IgM; don’t confuse that.

Since the IgG light chains are proteins and are present in ↑↑ amounts in the blood, they are prone to deposit in tissues, leading to amyloidosis (abnormal protein deposition in tissues); multiple myeloma is most common cause of renal and cardiac amyloidosis (this is all over the NBMEs); any renal/cardiac Dx in MM, answer = renal or cardiac amyloidosis.

The IgG light chains show up in the urine -> Bence-Jones proteinuria.

The IgG light chains cause RBCs to stick together -> Rouleaux formation + ↑↑ ESR (the Rouleaux are heavy, so the RBCs deposit at a faster rate).

Smear in multiple myeloma will show plasma cells (blue cells below) with “clockface chromatin,” which is the appearance ascribed to the nuclei (purple below).

“What are the highest yield points for Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia?”.

There is an IgM M-protein spike; in contrast, MM has an IgG M-protein spike; once again, the M in M-protein spike has zero to do with IgM; it’s just what we call the immunoglobulin spike. Students fuck this up a lot, which is why I have to be extra redundant explaining this.

Unlike MM, there is no hypercalcemia; there is no Bence-Jones proteinuria; ESR need not be elevated.

82F + back pain + hypercalcemia + high ESR; Dx? -> multiple myeloma.

64M + back pain + calcium normal + high BUN & Cr + low serum Na + high serum K + low serum bicarb + x-ray shows lytic lesions of spine + epistaxis + low Hb + high MCV; Dx? -> multiple myeloma causing renal amyloidosis, resulting in uremic platelet dysfunction and renal tubular acidosis type IV (insensitivity to aldosterone, or hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism -> Addisonian biochemistry but the problem is due to the kidney, not the adrenal glands); student says, “Wait, but why is calcium normal?” -> Great question; probably because renal failure causes low Ca, but MM causes high Ca, so the patient could theoretically be normocalcemic in MM if he/she also has renal failure (one NBME Q has normocalcemia in MM with renal failure); epistaxis due to uremic platelet dysfunction; low Hb due to nosebleeds; MCV can be elevated in multiple myeloma.

50F + serum protein electrophoresis shows M-spike + bone marrow biopsy shows <10% plasma cells; Dx? -> answer = monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS); 1-2% chance per year of progressing to multiple myeloma.
