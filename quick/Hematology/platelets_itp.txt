Normal bleeding time (BT)? -> answer = 2-7 minutes.

Two main ways ITP presents on USMLE? -> 1) school-age kid with viral infection followed by epistaxis and/or bruising/petechiae; 2) woman 30s-40s with random bruising and elevated BT / low platelets.

34F + bruises + BT 9 minutes; Dx? -> answer = idiopathic/immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).

34F + bruises + BT 6 minutes; Dx? -> answer = domestic abuse (on FM shelf).

34F + viral infection followed by petechiae + epistaxis; which would confirm the Dx (answers are either ↑ bleeding time or ↓ platelet count) -> answer = ↓ platelet count; both are seen, but an isolated ↓ platelet count in the setting of the clinical picture is how to confirm Dx of ITP.

12M + runny nose for 4 days + epistaxis; Dx? -> answer = ITP -> often follows viral infection.

12M + no mention of any type of infection + epistaxis + BT 8 minutes; Dx? -> answer = ITP -> student says, “Wait, but you just said it follows a viral infection.” -> USMLE need not mention viral infections, and they often don’t. Especially on 2CK-level NBME Qs, for conditions associated with viral infections like ITP, deQuervain subacute granulomatous thyroiditis, minimal change disease, IgA nephropathy, etc., the Q won’t even mention viral infection; you just need to know the presentation. Just think: most people with COVID-19 are/were asymptomatic right?

12M + cough + coryza + epistaxis; mechanism for this patient’s condition? -> answer = antibodies against glycoproteins IIb/IIIa on platelets (type II hypersensitivity); GpIIb/IIIa mediate platelet aggregation (not adhesion, which is GpIb, not IIb/IIIa); there is often a genetic susceptibility to ITP. This is asked on 2CK material as well.

12M + epistaxis + platelet count 50,000; next best step in management? -> answer = steroids.

12M + epistaxis + platelet count 50,000 + steroids not effective; next best step in management? -> answer = IVIG.

12M + epistaxis + platelet count 50,000; what’s the most effective way to decrease recurrence? -> answer = splenectomy; students says, “Wait, I thought you just said steroids were what we do first.” -> Yeah, you’re right, but the Q asks what’s most effective in decreasing recurrence, so splenectomy is correct. USMLE will sometimes ask next best step vs what’s most effective.

Two points to note about ITP Tx:.

▪ 2) Literature suggests sometimes IVIG may be given before steroids (i.e., extremely low platelet counts). But on the USMLE, steroids are always first, not IVIG.

12M + viral infection + low neutrophils; Dx? -> answer = viral-induced neutropenia (not ITP).

Normal activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT; PTT)? -> answer = 25-40 seconds. o aPTT is a slightly more sensitive version of PTT, but on USMLE they are used interchangeably. - 55F + no Hx of bleeding problems + coagulation testing prior to CABG shows ↑ PTT + normal PT + normal BT; what’s most likely to be abnormal in this patient? -> answer = USMLE answer is kallikrein formation. Patients with ↓ factor XII (Hageman factor) are asymptomatic; factor XII converts pre kallikrein into kallikrein.

Neonate + born at home + bleeding from umbilical site; what are the arrows for BT, PT, and aPTT? -> answer = normal BT; ↑ PT; ↑ aPTT; Dx = vitamin K deficiency. Born at home = not given vitK injection.

34F + DVT + PC 220,000 + PT 13 seconds + PTT 36 seconds + heparin commenced + now PC is 130,000; mechanism? -> answer = drug-related antibodies -> heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) -> type II hypersensitivity -> antibodies form against the heparin-platelet factor 4 complex.

How does a platelet problem present? -> epistaxis or generally mild cutaneous findings (i.e., petechiae, bruising).

17F + Hx of epistaxis + sometimes clots in her menstrual pads; Dx till proven otherwise? -> answer = von Willebrand disease (vWD) -> always presents with combination of platelet problem + clotting factor problem. Clots with menses signify heavy bleeding (i.e., menorrhagia).

Mechanism of von Willebrand factor? -> bridges GpIb on platelets to underlying collagen + vascular endothelium -> mediates platelet adhesion (don’t confuse this with platelet aggregation, which is when platelets stick together via GpIIb/IIIa); this leads to increased bleeding time. vWF also has secondary/ancillary function of stabilizing factor VIII in plasma -> in vWD, PTT is elevated in ~1/2 of question stems (students tend to erroneously memorize PTT as always ↑, but this will get you questions wrong).

17F + Hx of epistaxis + Hx of excessive bleeding with wisdom teeth removal + BT 9 minutes + PT 12 seconds + PTT 44 seconds; Dx? -> answer = vWD -> BT always ↑; PTT ↑ in only ~half of questions.

17F + Hx of epistaxis + cut her finger a month ago that took a long time to stop bleeding + PT normal + PTT normal + platelet aggregation studies normal; Dx? -> vWD -> the ↑ BT is reflected by the cut on the finger taking a while to stop bleeding; PTT need not be elevated; normal platelet aggregation studies simply mean that GpIIb/IIIa are functioning properly, but vWD relies on GpIb, which is adhesion, not aggregation.

19M + petechiae + normal platelet count + BT 9 minutes + PTT 42 seconds; Tx for this patient’s condition? -> answer = desmopressin (DDAVP) increases vWF synthesis and release.

16F + took aspirin in suicide attempt + ↓ Hb + blood in stool; Q asks what finding would be expected to be abnormal in this patient? -> answer = bleeding time (↑↑ because aspirin inhibits COX1/2 -> ↓ thromboxane A2 production in platelets -> ↓ platelet function); the wrong answer is ↓ platelet count (platelet count doesn’t change with aspirin/NSAID use); fibrin degradation products is also a wrong answer (this is ↑ in DIC and pulmonary embolism).

23M + BT 12 minutes + thrombocytopenia + smear shows giant platelets + failure of platelet agglutination with ristocetin cofactor; Dx + mechanism? -> answer = Bernard-Soulier disease; mechanism = deficiency of platelet GpIb (mediates adhesion); platelets can be giant for some magical reason.

23M + BT 12 minutes + normal platelet count + ristocetin cofactor assay yields agglutination; Dx + mechanism? -> answer = Glanzmann thrombasthenia; mechanism = deficiency of platelet glycoproteins IIb/IIIa (mediate aggregation, not adhesion). Student says, “Wait, but if it’s an isolated increase in BT, why can’t this just be ITP then?” -> Because platelet count is normal; in ITP, there’s always thrombocytopenia. I’ve seen this Dx on the NBMEs show up as just “thrombasthenia,” where you’re like “Wtf is thrombasthenia?” But that just refers to Glanzmann.

12F + chronic renal failure + epistaxis for past two weeks + platelets 200,000/uL + Hb 9.5 g/dL; Q asks the mechanism for the epistaxis; answer = “acquired platelet dysfunction”; Dx = uremic platelet dysfunction -> high blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in renal failure causes a qualitative dysfunction of platelets, where they merely don’t do their job; there is no quantitative issue (i.e,. platelet count is normal).

Students often choose “erythropoietin deficiency,” which is the wrong answer. Anemia of chronic disease can be seen in renal failure secondary to decreased EPO, yes, but AoCD in and of itself doesn’t cause epistaxis; epistaxis is seen with platelet problems; Hb is merely down because there’s IDA from the epistaxis.

↑ BT, PT, aPTT, D-dimer, plasmin activity; ↓ fibrinogen, platelets, clotting factors. o Fibrinogen is converted to fibrin, which is why it decreases.

D-dimer = fibrin degradation products; since more fibrin is being broken down, D-dimer ↑. o “Bleeding from catheter/IV sites” is 9 times out of 10 synonymous with DIC. However on one 2CK-level surgery NBME Q, dilutional thrombocytopenia secondary to ↑ blood transfusions presents the same.

40F + has surgery + requires 22 packs of RBCs transfused during the surgery + afterwards has bleeding from catheter/IV sites + DIC not listed as an answer; Dx? -> answer = thrombocytopenia; student says, “Wtf? I thought that description is DIC.” -> packed RBCs don’t contain platelets -> ↑↑ acute transfusions -> dilutional thrombocytopenia + can present with DIC-like picture in vignette. Weird I know, but you learn something new every day.

1) thrombocytopenia;.

Why autosplenectomy in sickle cell + what vaccines are needed? -> sickling in red pulp leads to microinfarcts -> any sickle cell patient needs vaccines for S. pneumo, H. influenzae type B, and Neisseria meningitidis.

Why are those vaccines needed? -> with splenectomy (or autosplenectomy), increased risk of infection with encapsulated organisms, which require opsonization and phagocytosis for clearance -> spleen white pulp is important site of phagocytosis (tangential: IgG and C3b are immune system’s main opsonins).

Tx for hereditary spherocytosis? -> answer = splenectomy for those with moderate-severe anemia; the spleen normally clears out the spherocytes, thereby enlarging and also causing chronic anemia.

8M + chronic anemia + father had Hx of splenectomy + smear is shown; inheritance pattern?

Answer = autosomal dominant; smear shows spherocytes. They love this detail about one of the parents having had splenectomy. I’ve seen students incorrectly answer sickle cell for this Q; sickle cell causes autosplenectomy; it isn’t treated with splenectomy.

40M + recent splenectomy; Q asks, what does the smear show here?

Answer = Howell-Jolly bodies within RBCs, which are nuclear remnants; normal finding post splenectomy.

Neonate + pathologic jaundice + father had Hx of splenectomy for chronic anemia; Dx? -> answer = hereditary spherocytosis.

11F + fatigue + Hb 6.5 + MCV 90 + reticulocyte count 9% (NR 0.5-1.5% of RBCs) + mother underwent splenectomy as a youth for “low blood” and recently had a cholecystectomy; what’s the most likely mechanism for this patient’s condition? -> answer = deficiency of erythrocyte spectrin.

What are some ADP P2Y12 receptor blockers? -> clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor, ticlopidine. - What are some GpIIb/IIIa inhibitors? -> abciximab, eptifibatide, tirofiban.
