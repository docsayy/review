“Can you explain PT and PTT in relation to extrinsic and intrinsic pathways?” o PT reflects the functioning of the extrinsic pathway; PTT reflects intrinsic. In other words, if PT alone is high, then the extrinsic pathway is fucked up. If PTT alone is high, then the intrinsic pathway has a problem. If both PT and PTT are elevated, then the common pathway has an issue.

Normal prothrombin time (PT)? -> answer = 10-15 seconds.

40M + on warfarin for prosthetic valve placed years ago + receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for infection; Q asks why required warfarin dosage over next several weeks would ↓; answer = “vitamin K deficiency caused by depletion of normal gut flora.”.

What does vitamin K do? -> cofactor for enzyme called gamma-glutamyl carboxylase -> gamma carboxylates + activates clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as anti-clotting proteins C and S. Since factors II (prothrombin) and X are in the common pathway, PT and PTT are both elevated in vitamin K deficiency. Factor VII is in the extrinsic pathway; factor IX in the intrinsic pathway. Protein C functions to inactivate factors Va and VIIIa (activated clotting factors V and VIII) back to their inactive form. Protein S is merely a cofactor for protein C.

How does warfarin relate to vitamin K? -> Warfarin inhibits vitamin K epoxide reductase, which is the enzyme that recycles vitamin K to its active form. That means less vitamin K can act as a cofactor for gamma-glutamyl carboxylase. Notice the enzymes are different. Therefore warfarin leads to decreased activation of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as anti-clotting proteins C and S.

“If proteins C and S are anti-clotting, and warfarin inhibits their activation, why would warfarin be an anticoagulant then?” -> protein C has a super-short half-life, so the effect of warfarin in the first few days actually results in a hypercoagulable state, where protein C is ↓ but the actual clotting factors are still present in greater amounts; this is why heparin is necessary as a bridging agent - i.e., patients commenced on warfarin require simultaneous commencement of heparin for a few days.

What does heparin do? -> activates antithrombin III -> leads to inactivation of prothrombin (factor II) and factor X.

How do you reverse warfarin? -> vitamin K (slow; takes several days); if patient is actively bleeding or requires surgery (i.e., fast reversal), answer = fresh frozen plasma.

How do you reverse heparin? -> protamine sulfate.

Anything important about the structures of heparin vs warfarin? -> heparin is a large, acidic, anionic molecule and therefore does not cross the placenta; protamine, which is a positively charged cation, can bind to and chelate it. Warfarin is a small lipophilic molecule that can cross the placenta, and is therefore teratogenic.

Tx for HIT -> stop heparin and give direct-thrombin inhibitor (e.g., dabigatran, lepirudin); warfarin is the number-one wrong answer.

How does a clotting factor problem present? -> menorrhagia; excessive bleeding after tooth extraction; hemarthrosis; excessive bleeding after circumcision (neonatal boys).

When students get above vignette wrong, it’s because they don’t realize PTT is normal in about half of vWD vignettes and/or they forget vWF mediates platelet adhesion, not aggregation.

8M + hemarthrosis + PTT 90 seconds; Dx? -> answer = hemophilia A or B -> isolated ↑ in PTT.

Hemarthrosis in school-age boy; Dx till proven otherwise? -> answer = hemophilia A or B.

Hemarthrosis in school-age boy + no way to differentiate between A and B based on the vignette; Dx?

> answer = hemophilia A (way more common than B); for some reason, this epidemiologic point is assessed on the Step in this fashion.

8-day-old neonatal male + excessive bleeding with circumcision; Dx? -> answer = hemophilia A or B.

Inheritance pattern of hemophilia A and B? -> X-linked recessive (high-yield).

Mechanism for hemophilia A and B? -> answer = deficient production of factors VIII (A) and IX (B). Rarely, they can be caused by antibodies against the factors.

Tx for hemophilia A? -> answer = IV desmopressin (DDAVP) and/or factor VIII replacement.

Tx for hemophilia B? -> answer = factor IX replacement only.

15M + Hx of receiving factor VIII replacement therapy for hemophilia A + becoming increasingly less effective with time + PTT is 160 seconds; Dx? -> answer = antibodies against factor VIII (almost always due to repeated replacement of factor VIII).

13F + PTT 90 seconds + analysis shows deficiency of factor IX; Q asks the mechanism via which this is possible -> answer = lyonization (skewed X-inactivation); the USMLE Q will never give a female with.

28F + just gave birth + two minutes after separation of placenta gets shortness of breath and tachycardia + bleeding from IV + catheter sites; Dx? -> answer = disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) secondary to amniotic fluid embolism.

32F + SLE + DVT + PTT of 60 seconds; Dx? -> answer = antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS) -> APLS is the answer when the patient has thromboses despite a paradoxically high aPTT (you’d normally expect bleeding diathesis with high aPTT). This is because phospholipid is necessary for proper functioning of the clotting cascade, so the in vitro PTT test doesn’t work as well (therefore ↑), but the antibodies cause clotting factor activation in vivo. APLS has numerous causes: you can have APL antibodies in the setting of SLE (we just happen to call these Abs lupus anticoagulant), but we can also have Abs against beta-2-microglobulin and cardiolipin, unrelated to SLE. Patients with APLS can sometimes have a false-positive VDRL screening test for syphilis.

65M + warfarin-induced skin necrosis; patient most likely has what? -> answer = protein C deficiency -> short half-life of protein C, which is depleted by warfarin, leads to ↑↑ hypercoagulable state in someone innately deficient.

23M + thrombosis + no mention of ↑ PTT; Dx (FVL, prothrombin mutation, protein C/S deficiency are not listed)? -> answer = antithrombin deficiency; wrong answer is antiphospholipid syndrome (presumably for APLS the vignette will mention ↑ PTT if male patient, or recurrent miscarriage in female).
