12M + viral infection + low neutrophils + fever; next best step in Dx + Mx? -> answer = neutropenic fever (febrile neutropenia) -> medical emergency; must give immediate IV broad-spectrum antibiotics; patient has possible infection but no way to defend against it.

12M + low neutrophils + fever + antibiotics are administered; what could help restore this patient’s neutrophil count? -> answer = granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF); molgramostim is commonly used as the GM-CSF agent.

44F + hospitalized and treated for overactive thyroid + Hct 45% + WBCs 1500 (neutrophils 5%; lymphocytes 95%) + PC 250,000; Dx? -> answer = drug-induced neutropenia -> propylthiouracil and methimazole both can cause agranulocytosis (neutropenia); other HY drugs for agranulocytosis are ganciclovir (for CMV), clozapine (anti-psychotic), methotrexate (DMARD), ticlopidine (anti-platelet).

8M + viral infection + low Hb + low WBCs + low platelets + fever; next best step? -> answer = immediate IV antibiotics -> even though viral-induced aplastic anemia, the patient still has a neutropenic fever, so this is a medical emergency.

Side-effects of methotrexate? -> pulmonary fibrosis, hepatotoxicity, neutropenia. - How to mitigate toxicity of methotrexate? -> folinic acid (leucovorin rescue), not folic acid. - MOA of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)? -> thymidylate synthase inhibitor.
