3M + absent thumb on the left hand + ↓ Hb + ↓ WBCs + ↓ platelets; Dx? -> answer = Fanconi anemia; autosomal recessive aplastic anemia; presents with absent or hypoplastic thumbs or radii.

3M + triphalangeal thumb + ↓ RBCs; Dx? -> answer = Diamond-Blackfan anemia; pure RBC aplasia that presents with triphalangeal thumb.

Cancer associated with pure RBC aplasia? -> answer = thymoma.

8M + viral infection + low Hb + low WBCs + low platelets; what’s the next best step in Dx? -> answer = bone marrow aspiration (to confirm decreased bone marrow production consistent with aplastic anemia); sounds overkill, but it’s the answer.

44F + undergoing chemotherapy + low RBCs + low WBCs + low platelets; next best step in Dx? -> answer = bone marrow aspiration (chemo-induced aplastic anemia).

“When is reticulocyte count elevated?” -> normal range is 0.5-1.5% of RBCs (according to NBME); if high, indicates hemorrhage, hemolytic anemia, or ↑ RBC turnover (i.e., hereditary spherocytosis; enzyme deficiencies; transfusion reactions; thalassemia when accompanied by severe anemia); if normal or low, then iron deficiency; aplastic anemia; thalassemia not accompanied by severe anemia.
