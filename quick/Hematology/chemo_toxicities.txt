34M + new-onset fatigue + lives in house in winter with new ventilator + also just purchased second hand refrigerator + pulse oximetry 94%; Q asks “What in this patient’s house is causing his condition?” -> answer = ventilator -> Dx is CO poisoning; the mention of the refrigerator in the above Q is a distractor (for those thinking cyanide toxicity, the association is not classic); student says, “Wait, I thought you just said pulse oximetry is normal in CO poisoning. Isn’t normal 98-100%?” -> Yes, but Qs have been known to have Hb saturation as low as 94% in CO poisoning.

34M + housefire + confusion + burned upholstery + O2 sats normal; Dx? -> answer = cyanide toxicity; classically caused by inhaling fumes from burned upholstery.

34M + BP of 250/130 + no confusion; sodium nitroprusside is administered then develops confusion; Dx? -> answer = cyanide toxicity, not hypertensive encephalopathy; CN toxicity can be caused by sodium nitroprusside. Dumb trick, but on USMLE.

Mechanism for CN toxicity? -> binds to cytochrome oxidase and “inhibits transfer of electrons to molecular oxygen”; that is: it interferes with the electron-transport chain.

Tx for cyanide toxicity? -> answer = amyl nitrite (answer on NBME) -> the nitrites cause methemoglobinemia; cyanide binds readily to Fe3+, forming cyanmethemoglobin, thereby releasing the CN from cytochrome oxidase. Sodium thiosulfate and hydroxocobalamin are also used.

Tx for lead toxicity? -> Tx not indicated unless serum levels >44 ng/dL (weirdly specific, but asked on 2CK/3); give dimercaprol or EDTA in adults; succimer is often used for children.

How does iron toxicity present? -> GI bleeding HY on USMLE; can also cause ↑ anion-gap metabolic acidosis (Iron and INH are the I in MUDPILES).

MOA of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP)? -> PRPP amidotransferase inhibitor (purine synthesis inhibitor). - MOA of azathioprine? -> metabolized into 6-MP -> then inhibits purine synthesis. - MOA of hydroxyurea? -> ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor (pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor). - MOA of mycophenolate mofetil? -> inhibits IMP dehydrogenase (inhibits purine synthesis). - Microtubule inhibitors? -> colchicine, -bendazoles (mebendazole, albendazole), vincristine, vinblastine, taxanes (paclitaxel/docetaxel), griseofulvin.

Which microtubule inhibitor is the odd one out? -> paclitaxel/docetaxel -> hyperstabilize microtubules; the others inhibit formation.

Toxicity of vincristine? -> neurotoxic.

MOA of bleomycin? -> causes free radical formation.

Toxicity of bleomycin? -> pulmonary fibrosis.

MOA of doxorubicin (Adriamycin) / daunorubicin? -> DNA intercalators + cause free radicals. - Toxicity of doxorubicin/daunorubicin? -> dilated cardiomyopathy.

How to mitigate the toxicity of doxorubicin/daunorubicin? -> dexrazoxane -> chelates free radicals. - MOA of erlotinib? -> EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

MOA of trastuzumab (Herceptin)? -> monoclonal Ab against HER-2/neu (ERBB2). - Toxicity of trastuzumab? -> cardiotoxicity.

MOA of cyclophosphamide? -> guanine N7 alkylating agent.

Major side-effect of cyclophosphamide? -> hemorrhagic cystitis due to metabolite called acrolein. - How to mitigate toxicity of cyclophosphamide? -> Mesna (contains thiol -SH group). - MOA of tacrolimus? -> antagonist at FK506 receptor -> decreases intracellular calcineurin -> decreases IL-2 transcription -> decreases T cell function.

Important side-effects of tacrolimus -> type II diabetes, nephrotoxicity.

Important side-effects of cyclosporin -> nephrotoxicity, hypertension, gingival hyperplasia, hypertrichosis.

Important side-effect of sirolimus -> dyslipidemia; notably not nephrotoxic.

How to mitigate toxicity of cisplatin? -> saline infusion (NaCl, were the Cl- helps), followed by amifostine.

MOA of rituximab? -> CD20 inhibitor on B cells.
