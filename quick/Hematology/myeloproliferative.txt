63M + fullness in LUQ + low Hb + high uric acid + bone marrow aspiration shows dry tap; Dx? -> answer = myelofibrosis -> “massive splenomegaly” often seen in NBME (fullness of LUQ); Hb can be low from myelophthisic anemia (crowding of bone marrow leading to anemia); myelofibrosis due to JAK2 mutation (same as PCV). Student says, “Wait but why high uric acid? Isn’t that gout?” -> can be seen sometimes with increased cell turnover, including RBCs (precursors have nucleic acid).

Answer = myelofibrosis -> dacrocytes = teardrop-shaped RBCs -> HY for myelofibrosis; key terms are: “massive splenomegaly,” “dry tap,” “teardrop RBCs”).

Answer = leukemoid reaction; smear shows neutrophilia consistent with infection (UTI in this case); answer can also be written on NBME as “reactive granulocytosis.”.

Leukemoid reaction = increased release of leukocytes from bone marrow reserve pool. WBC count will be >30k. There is NBME Q where it’s 32k.
