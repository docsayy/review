Answer = dietary B12 deficiency; smear shows hypersegmented neutrophil.

“What is a hypersegmented neutrophil?” -> seen in folate (B9) or B12 deficiency; ↓ DNA synthesis results in neutrophils with >3 segments to the nuclei. Essentially if you see these on a smear, right away you should be thinking B9 or B12 deficiency; patient will also have ↑ MCV.

22M + vitiligo + vegetarian + ↑ MCV + hypersegmented neutrophils; Dx? -> answer = pernicious anemia causing B12 deficiency (one autoimmune disease -> ↑ risk of others [polyglandular syndromes]).

22M + vitiligo + vegetarian + ↑ MCV + hypersegmented neutrophils; next best step? -> answer = check serum antibodies against parietal cells and intrinsic factor.

27F + strict vegetarian diet for 5 years + ↓ Hb + ↓ Hct + ↓ WBCs + ↓ platelets + no other info given; Q asks, her nutrient deficiency significantly impairs which of the following cellular processes; answer = DNA synthesis (B12 deficiency); wrong answer is heme production (instead B6 deficiency).

22M + Hx of epilepsy + ↑ MCV + hypersegmented neutrophils; Dx? -> B9 deficiency -> anti-epileptic meds (i.e., valproic acid, phenytoin, carbamazepine) cause ↓ intestinal folate absorption.

44M + alcoholic + ↑ MCV + no hypersegmented neutrophils + serum methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels normal + smear is shown; Dx?

Answer = alcohol-induced sideroblastic anemia -> alcohol can cause ↑ MCV. But since there’s no impairment of DNA synthesis, there are no hypersegmented neutrophils; alcohol can merely disrupt the heme synthesis pathway, where MCV can sometimes ↑.

Methylmalonic acid (or methylmalonyl-CoA) is ↑ in B12 deficiency; homocysteine is ↑ in both B9 and B12 deficiencies.

Drugs that are anti-fibrinolytics? -> tranexamic acid, aminocaproic acid (can help reverse tPA). - MOA of methotrexate? -> reversible, competitive inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase; first-line DMARD for RA.
