8M + viral infection + low Hb + low WBCs + low platelets; Dx? -> answer = aplastic anemia (viral induced; likely Parvo-B19); aplastic anemia = Dx when all cell lines are down due to decreased bone marrow production).

32F + malar rash + arthritis + Hb 9 + WBCs 3000 + platelets 90,000; mechanism for this hematologic presentation? -> answer = “increased peripheral destruction” (i.e., autoantibodies); “decreased bone marrow production” is the wrong answer in SLE; lupus is associated with the development of anti hematologic cell line antibodies, usually against platelets (i.e., it’s common to see isolated thrombocytopenia in SLE), but antibodies can form against WBCs and RBCs as well. What makes this difficult is that a ↓ in all cell lines (i.e., RBCs, WBCs, platelets) looks like aplastic anemia (i.e., such as with Parvo), but with SLE, the finding is due to antibodies, not defective bone marrow production. In contrast, if this were viral-induced, then yes, that is aplastic anemia, and the answer is “decreased bone marrow production.”.

26F + daycare worker + coryza + lacy rash on legs and trunk + all immunizations up to date + afebrile + RBCs, WBCs, and platelets all normal; next best step in Dx? -> answer = “check Parvovirus IgM titers” -> in the absence of aplastic anemia, this is the answer if daycare worker presents with rash.

44F + undergoing chemotherapy + all cell lines down + temperature 101.8F; next best step? -> answer = immediate IV broad-spectrum antibiotics; this is chemo-induced aplastic anemia, but there’s a neutropenic fever.

“Wait what’s that ristocetin assay thing. I’ve seen that before.” -> all you need to know is that it will cause platelet agglutination, but in Bernard-Soulier disease and vWD, the assay is negative - i.e., the platelets don’t agglutinate. The test measures the binding of vWD to platelet GpIb, so clearly deficiency of either will yield a negative test.

“Can you explain DIC?” -> intractable clotting cascade activation in the setting of manifold triggers such as trauma, sepsis, amniotic fluid embolism, Tx of AML with release of Auer rods into circulation -> USMLE wants you to know the arrows in DIC (high-yield):.

4F + leukocytes 78,000/uL (87% lymphocytes) + low Hb + low platelets + lymphadenopathy; Dx? -> answer = acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) -> pretty much always the answer for leukemia in peds -> normal leukocyte count is 4-11,000/uL -> high leukocytes in peds with lymphocyte-predominant spread should scream ALL. Leukemia is usually B cell.

ALL; lymphoblasts appear smooth and relatively uniform.

6M + WBCs 56,000 (mostly lymphocytes) + flushing of the face; Dx? -> T cell ALL (TALL) -> if SVC-like syndrome is seen due to thymic lesion, answer is T cell, not B cell, variant.

3F + one-month Hx of fatigue + WBCs 3500 + low Hb + low platelets + lymphadenopathy; next best step in Dx? -> answer = bone marrow aspiration -> Dx = ALL. Student says, “I thought you just said though that WBCs would be high.” -> can rarely have normal or low leukocyte counts; one NBME Q has vignette resembling aplastic anemia + lymphadenopathy -> answer is bone marrow aspiration, which is confirmatory for ALL. The non-acute presentation suggests leukemia over viral-induced aplastic anemia.

3M + trisomy 21 + pancytopenia + examination of bone marrow will show what? -> answer = excess lymphoblasts -> increased risk of ALL in Down syndrome (and AML type VII, but in peds the answer is almost always ALL).

Answer = acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) -> image of Auer rods is exceedingly HY for the Step; Auer rods are composed of myeloperoxidase, which is a blue-green heme containing pigment; Tx of AML leads to lysis of cells -> Auer rods released into circulation and precipitate DIC.

56M + ↑↑ WBCs + t(15;17); Dx + Tx? -> answer = acute promyelocytic leukemia (AML type M3); Tx is all-trans retinoic acid (vitamin A).

82F + fever 103F + gram (+) diplococci on sputum sample + WBCs 82,000 (87% lymphocytes); Dx + next best step in management? -> answer = chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); next best step -> NBME answer = “quantitative immunoglobulin assay” -> apparently ordered for those with chronic infections when IgG is low (can be seen in leukemia). HY points:.

In addition, Strep pneumo causes an extracellular bacterial infection, so the shift should be toward neutrophils (normal range ~55-60%, where bacterial shift would be ~65-90%), so if the shift is toward lymphocytes, that should scream ALL or CLL. ALL would be the answer for peds, however, not adults.

Important you’re tangentially aware that pertussis can cause WBCs >30,000 with a lymphocyte shift; resembles ALL in peds; always a wtf finding when you first learn of it; but just say: “Ok, super high WBCs with lymphocyte shift -> ALL, CLL, or pertussis.”.

Answer = CLL; smear shows smudge cells; CLL sometimes associated with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (usually warm), hence a (+) Coombs test may be seen.

61F + high WBCs + CD5 and CD23 positivity + positive Coombs test; Dx? -> answer = CLL; leukemic cells in CLL can be CD5 and/or CD23 positive (on retired Step 1 NBME).

Answer = CML; smear shows “motley mix” of many different types of cells (HY image).

44F + WBCs 14,500 + metamyelocytes and myelocytes seen on FBC + decreased leukocyte ALP; Dx? -> answer = chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML); metamyelocytes and myelocytes are extremely HY for CML; leukocyte ALP is also decreased.

44F + WBCs 32,000 + metamyelocytes and myelocytes seen on FBC + increased leukocyte ALP; Dx? -> answer = leukemoid reaction (inflammatory process; usually infection); the other HY condition that, like CML, can present with metamyelocytes and myelocytes, however leukocyte ALP is increased.

44F + WBC 180,000 (50% neutrophils) + t(9;22); Dx? -> answer = CML -> Philadelphia chromosome -> t(9;22) bcr/abl -> oncogenic tyrosine kinase.

Tx of CML? -> answer = imatinib.

Important side-effect of imatinib? -> answer = fluid retention (edema); tangentially, apart from imatinib, know that dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (nifedipine, amlodipine, etc.) also cause fluid retention/edema.

9M + African-American + abdominal mass growing left of umbilicus + fever + night sweats + weight loss + cytogenetic analysis reveals t(8;14); Dx? -> answer = Burkitt lymphoma; students says, “Wait, I thought it was supposed to be a jaw lesion.” -> can be intra-abdominal or jaw.

9M + African-American + unilateral jaw swelling + t(2;8) + biopsy of lesion is shown; Dx?

USMLE Step 1 assesses t(2;8), t(8;14), and (8;22) for Burkitt; resources tend to only focus on t(8;14); easy way to remember: you can see that chromosome 8 is involved in all of them.

26M + waxing and waning neck mass over one-year period + t(14;18); Dx? -> answer = follicular lymphoma; may present with waxing/waning disease.

41F + lymphoma + t(11;14); Dx? -> answer = mantle cell lymphoma.

9F + WBC 3,500 + smear shows WBCs with cytoplasmic projections that stain positive for acid resistant acid phosphatase; Dx? -> answer = hairy cell leukemia; can have low WBC count.

“Do I need to know the heme synthesis pathway?” -> Annoying, but yes. The heme pathway disorders are all over the NBMEs for Step 1.

40M + episodes of blistering from sun + ↑ urine uroporphyrin III; Q asks which compound serves as the precursor to uroporphyrin in this patient -> answer = succinyl-CoA -> required for the initiation of heme synthesis (glycine not listed but by all means also correct).

Bite cells are pathognomonic for G6PD deficiency -> spleen phagocytoses part, but not all, of RBC, resulting in characteristic “bitten” appearance on smear. Heinz bodies are precipitated / oxidized hemoglobin seen toward the periphery of the RBC.

MOA of imatinib? -> bcr/abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor for CML -> causes fluid retention (edema). - MOA of tamoxifen/raloxifene? -> selective estrogen-receptor modulators (SERMs). - Important distinction between tamoxifen and raloxifene? -> both are antagonists at ER receptors on.

Cyclosporin + tacrolimus -> ↓ calcineurin + ↓ IL-2 transcription + nephrotoxic. o Sirolimus -> no change calcineurin + ↓ responsiveness to IL-2 + not nephrotoxic. - Important points about cisplatin -> causes oto- and neurotoxicity; all over 2CK-level neuro shelf exams as causing “toxic neuropathy” (chemo-induced neuropathy).
