Prothrombin time measures the extrinsic pathway.

Activated partial thromboplastin time measures the intrinsic pathway.

If PT is prolonged alone, the extrinsic pathway is affected.

If PTT is prolonged alone, the intrinsic pathway is affected.

If both PT and PTT are prolonged, the common pathway is affected.

Bleeding time reflects platelet function.

Bleeding time does not measure clotting factors.
