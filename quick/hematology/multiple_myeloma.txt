Multiple myeloma is a malignancy of plasma cells.

Plasma cells produce immunoglobulins.

Multiple myeloma causes markedly increased serum immunoglobulins.

Classic presentation is age over 50 with back pain and hypercalcemia.

Hypercalcemia is caused by lytic bone lesions.

First diagnostic test is serum protein electrophoresis.

Serum protein electrophoresis shows a monoclonal M-spike.

Bone marrow biopsy confirms diagnosis with more than 10 percent plasma cells.

Urine may show Bence Jones proteins.

Rouleaux formation on smear is caused by immunoglobulin coating of red cells.

Multiple myeloma increases erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

Amyloidosis can occur from light chain deposition.

Initial treatment includes intravenous bisphosphonates to prevent bone loss.

MGUS has less than 10 percent plasma cells in bone marrow.
