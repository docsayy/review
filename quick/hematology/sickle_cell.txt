Sickle cell disease is caused by a beta-globin missense mutation replacing glutamic acid with valine.

It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.

Sickling occurs in deoxygenated conditions.

Dehydration and acidosis promote sickling.

Sickle cell crises cause pain in chest, abdomen, or bones.

Hydroxyurea increases fetal hemoglobin and reduces crises.

Sickle cell trait confers resistance to malaria.
