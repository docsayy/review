Anemia of chronic disease occurs in renal failure, autoimmune disease, chronic infection, or malignancy.

Hemoglobin is decreased in anemia of chronic disease.

Serum iron is low in anemia of chronic disease.

Ferritin is normal or increased in anemia of chronic disease.

Normal ferritin indicates iron stores are adequate.

Inflammatory cytokines block iron release from storage sites.

Hepcidin decreases gut iron absorption and increases iron storage.

Renal failure causes anemia of chronic disease through decreased erythropoietin production.

Erythropoietin is given only when anemia of chronic disease is due to renal failure.

Mean corpuscular volume may be normal or low in anemia of chronic disease.
