Polycythemia vera is caused by a JAK2 mutation.

It causes increased red cells and often increased white cells and platelets.

Elevated hemoglobin causes hyperviscosity symptoms.

Erythropoietin levels are suppressed in polycythemia vera.

Acute hyperviscosity symptoms are treated with phlebotomy.

Secondary polycythemia is caused by increased erythropoietin.

Secondary polycythemia shows isolated red cell elevation.

Chronic hypoxia is a common cause of secondary polycythemia.

Renal cell carcinoma can cause secondary polycythemia by ectopic erythropoietin production.
