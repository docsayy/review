Iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia both present with microcytic anemia.

Thalassemia is caused by abnormal synthesis of alpha or beta globin chains.

On exams, thalassemia appears as microcytic anemia despite normal iron and ferritin.

Another classic presentation is microcytic anemia that does not improve with iron supplementation.

Iron deficiency anemia is most common in menstruating women even if menses are normal.

Mean corpuscular volume is decreased in both iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia.

Serum iron is decreased in iron deficiency anemia and normal in thalassemia.

Ferritin is decreased in iron deficiency anemia and normal in thalassemia.

Hemoglobin electrophoresis is normal in iron deficiency anemia.

Beta-thalassemia shows increased HbA2 and HbF on hemoglobin electrophoresis.

Alpha-thalassemia usually has a normal hemoglobin electrophoresis.

Iron therapy improves iron deficiency anemia.

Iron therapy does not improve thalassemia.

Red cell distribution width is increased in iron deficiency anemia.

Red cell distribution width is normal or low in thalassemia.

Peripheral smear in iron deficiency anemia shows pale red cells with increased central pallor.

Peripheral smear in thalassemia shows target cells.

Target cells are highly suggestive of thalassemia.
